# Neural Network Architectures

This project hosts a collection of custom neural network architectures I implemented with PyTorch.
I am especially interested in Graph Neural Networks and Transformer architectures.
See below for a list of the implementations so far.

## Graph Neural Networks
- [x] Graph Attention Networks (GAT)
  - [x] GAT with Paired Nodes Attention
  - [x] GAT with Masked Self-Attention 
- [ ] Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)
